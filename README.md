## 3. Analysis 

### (1) Geographical Distribution of Innovation

- In terms of the number of patent
  - related to the urban scaling studies
  - number of patents per 1000 residents
  - expecting college towns have higher score?

- In terms of citation
  - Quality of innovation 
  - number of citation per patent 

- Comparison across disciplines
  - How does the urbanity of a region affects the quantity and quality of innovation?
